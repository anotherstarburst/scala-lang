Scaladoc is Scala's main documentation _tool_. Scaladoc is a documentation
system that lives in the comments of Scala source code and which generates
documentation related to the code structure within which it is written. It is
based on other comment based documentation systems like Javadoc.

There are two flavors of Scaladoc documentation:

  - **[Using the Scaladoc interface](interface)** – how to navigate and use generated Scaladoc documentation to learn more about a library.
  - **[Generating documentation for your library with Scaladoc](for-library-authors)** – how to use Scaladoc to generate documentation for your library.

### Contributing to Scaladoc

If you are interested in contributing to the API documentation of the Scala
standard library (the documentation generated by Scaladoc), please read the
[Scaladoc for Library Authors](for-library-authors) first.

If you'd like to contribute to the actual Scaladoc documentation generation
tool itself, then please see the
[Hacker Set Up Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/contribute/hacker-guide.html#2-set-up)
which covers the steps and workflow necessary work on the Scaladoc tool.
